# ABSTRACT
<center>
  <p align="justify">
       Individuals whose teething period deviates from the expected 
    timeframe or whose biological and physiological ages diverge from their 
    chronological age pose challenges for dental care planning. This 
    discrepancy complicates the provision of effective dental healthcare, 
    underscoring the importance of early diagnosis. Early identification not only 
    addresses dental health issues but also enables timely intervention in other
    disorders causing misalignment between tooth age and chronological age.
    Additionally, dental age and gender estimation find applications in 
    anthropology and forensic science. Estimating age and gender from
    panoramic radiographs typically demands expert evaluation, relying on 
    personal skills and expertise, which can lead to potential errors. Presently, 
    artificial intelligence systems have been introduced to alleviate challenges 
    associated with expert evaluation. However, a lingering concern is the 
    trustworthiness of the model's decisions.<br>
    <br>
       We also demonstrate that the <b>DeepToothDuo</b> model produces 
    improved interpretability results using SHAP. The researchers trained the 
    language model for application in developing web applications aimed at 
    answering users' dental questions. Our proposed model achieves a gender 
    prediction accuracy of <b>87.38%</b> and exhibits an age estimation error of <b>1.96 years.</b>
    Model interpretability studies reveal that the model considers anatomical 
    features consistent with existing studies on dental and human anatomy.
